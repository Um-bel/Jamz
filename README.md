step #3, put bots TOKEN in a .env file  
step #4, set up a database with mongoose.db or if you're compitent with node.js, edit the code for a different database of your chooseing.  

//some commands will need these to work:  
step #1, for call of duty commands "npm install call-of-duty-api" and put your call of duty login, inside a .env file         
step #2, for the image command "npm install images-scraper"

step #4, for the play command "npm install ytdl-core" and "npm install yt-search" 
step #5, for the weather command "npm install weather-js"
step #6, go through the commands, and the command handlers and see if i left out any things you need for the bot to work.

use the >cod-help command for the call of duty commands 
use the >p-help command for the play commands
