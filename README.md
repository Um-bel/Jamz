im having issues with my bot, every time i run it works fine, it'll go online and console.log it. great!
but when i go into discord and do >ping or >anthing. it will send an error:

if(!message.content.startsWith(prefix) || message.author.bot) return;
                        ^
TypeError: Cannot read property 'startsWith' of undefined

and im just hopeing someone will know what to do.
