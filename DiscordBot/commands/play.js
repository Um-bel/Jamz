//this works but there are still a few problems 

//problem 1: the quality is god awful. this is most likey because its going off of my bad wifi. 
//potential fixes 1: get a data base. 
//problem 1.1: ok so i got a database and the quality got worse?! this is because A. the data base is free and is going at a max of 512 mbs per sec, B. because its located in virginia, but thats not even that far away. 

//problem 2: its, inpractical. theres no quene, so if you want to play multiple songs at once you just have to wait for your current song to end before you can play another one. 
//potential fixes 2: add a quene, idk how you would do this via code, but im sure there's a tutorial or two on it somewhere

//problem 2.5: again, its inpractical. you can only play songs off youtube. this is just limiting the library and potential a lot
//potential fixes 2.5: make it so it can use spotify links as well. this will greatly increase the library of songs. 
//potential fixes 2.6: as a continuation of 2.5, not only spotify but also pandora, google play, soundcloud, and amazon music would also be good picks. though, i think spotify would be good enough.
